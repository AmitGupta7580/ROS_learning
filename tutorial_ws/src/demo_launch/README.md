##Theory:

Once all the node of your package run indivisually then you can run all the node by just one command `roslaunch <PACKAGE_NAME> <LAUNCH_FILE>`

##Instructions: 

1. Create a folder `launch` inside your package and put all of your launch files inside it.
2. Create a file with extension `.launch` and give the order in which you want to run your codes.
